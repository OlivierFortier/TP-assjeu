Thanks for downloading this first Premium BLUEPRINTS package.

Please could you take a minute and STAR rate and possible review the package

I have many Premium BLUEPRINTS package in the pipeline to land in the Asset Store.

BLUEPRINTS:
BLUEPRINTS is another word for Prefab.
It is in essence a receipy/design/BLUEPRINT for a building /village/outpost/farmyard layout.
These files will state on the package page what BASE normal package(s) you would need to open and be able to use them.

Sword & Shield Inn package requirement:
Village Interiors Kit v1,9 or higher
https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17033
Village Exteriors Kit v1.2.2a
https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/38045

How to open the Sword & Shield Inn BLUEPRINT:
- Just download and unpack the package.
- Example install directory
      Assets\3DForge\Blueprints\PremiumBlueprints\PBP_VIK_VEK\Sword&ShieldInn
- There you have your ready use prefab that you can move to another project space if you  want.
Basement digging:
VERY IMPORTANT!!!
Unity Terrain can not be pushed down below "0"
If you plan on doing any digging out, start a terrain by using the brush method that you specify the height. Sset it to more than enough, say 7 units, set brush to max size and strength to max and raise the whole terrain surface to that height.
This will give you more than enough room for any digging.
It is really easy, you going to be surprised that no one did it before.
You would use the second terrain manipulation tool, the one that you can specify the hight you want to brush/sculpt terrain to.
Just make sure that as in the example, the depth is set to at least 3.05 to sufficiently give room for the interiors.
The extra .05 is just to make sure that the floor tiles that will be used for the interiors will not z-fight with them.
You can add nice large basement, the whole size of a plinth

Enjoy
